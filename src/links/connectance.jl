    connectance(N::AbstractEcologicalNetwork)

Number of links divided by the number of possible interactions. In unipartite
networks, this is ``L/S^2``. In bipartite networks, this is ``L/(T Ã— B)``. It is
worth noting that while the maximal connectance is always 1 (i.e. the graph is
complete), the minimum value (assuming that the network is not degenerate) is
*not* 0. Instead, the minimum number of interactions in a unipartite network is
`S-1`, and in a bipartite network it is `max(T,B)`.

Connectance can therefore be transformed between 0 and 1, using the following
approach: let `m` be the minimum number of interactions, and Co be the measured
connectance, then the corrected value is `(Co-m)/(1-m)`. To our best knowledge,
this is not standard practice, and therefore is not suggested as a function in
the package.
